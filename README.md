## Using React Boilerplate, create an application.

Please take a full week to complete the project; there is no benefit to finishing early. It is important to take the time to understand the libraries listed below. Take the time to study the example repo within the boilerplate. It will help illustrate how these libraries fit together.

## The application’s Server should:

- Utilize a Node / Express server.
- Contain an array of strings.
- Have one endpoint to fetch all strings.
- Have one endpoint to prepend a new string to the array.

## The application’s Client should:

- Have one page to display all strings stored on server.
- Have one page with UI to input a string and send to server.
- Allow a user to navigate between the two pages.
- Not be fully styled, but should be laid out in a meaningful way.

## The application must leverage:

- React Router
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Reselect
- Styled Components - Use at least one styled component. The component must have a prop passed into the Styled Component for conditional rendering.
- Unit Tests - Write tests for one container. (Full test coverage is not required.)

## Helpful Tips:

- Focus on developing for the worst-case scenario, not the best-case.
- Be sure to give the user as much visual feedback as possible, for example showing a loading indicator while data is being retrieved.
- No need to setup a database or persist data.
- No need to deploy the application.
